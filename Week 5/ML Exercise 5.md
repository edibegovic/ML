[+] Discrete attributes with many values are generally favord by the impurity measure if no further "normalization"/penalization is applied. 

[+] Binary decision nodes are simpler for humas to grasp - given that interpretability is one of the main advantages of the descision tree.

[+] Allows for more flixibility. If a certain value doesn't contribute enough as an individual attribute, we can ignore it during the tree construction and also get rid of it during post-pruning.
